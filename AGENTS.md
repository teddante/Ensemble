Follow DRY.
Use internet search often to double check we are using latest and most optimal/recommended conventions etc...
Don't want backwards compatiblilty deprecated/legacy stuff in the code. Don't want compatibility shims or anything like that.
Are there any other philosophies/principles/paradigms/patterns that should/could be used.
We should be aiming to do everything in the most optimal way possible in the least amount of code.
